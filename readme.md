# Deno Demo

I took some inspirational from Sciuti talk and after reading some posts about Deno, I decided to have my hands dirty on Deno code and try to mimic a Node Express Application with Deno Oak.

## Must have...

You have to install Deno and Denon. See my post on [Dev.to]() to follow my guide about Deno.

## Start

Set you preferred port on `.env` (rename the `.env.sample` in `.env) and run with:

```
denon start
```

Open your browser and navigate to your `localhost:PORT`
